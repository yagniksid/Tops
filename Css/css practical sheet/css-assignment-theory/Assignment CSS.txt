what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

Q: What are the disadvantages of CSS? 
A: There could be cross-browser issues while using CSS.
  -There are multiple levels of CSS such as CSS, CSS 2, CSS 3. This can create confusion for non-developers and beginners.

Q: What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?
A: CSS3 is split into many various documents known as Modules. each module adds new capability or extends options outlined in
   CSS2 over conserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS3 started around the time of publication of the initial CSS2 recommendation.
  -The CSS3 version supports more browsers than CSS2.
  -CSS3 introduces several new selectors. Those new selectors square measure largely in an exceeding type of pseudo-elements and pseudo-categories.

Q: Name a few CSS style components.
A: Selector: class name, id name or element name that is target
  -Attribute: name of the attribute you want to style for example border, color, background, position etc.
  -Value of Property: value that will be assigned to attribute.

Q: What do you understand by CSS opacity?
A: The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden,
   and is the opposite of transparency.

Q: How can the background color of an element be changed? 
A: Use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or code you want and place it inside a style attribute.

Q: How can image repetition of the backup be controlled? 
A: To control the repetition of an image in the background, use the background-repeat property.

Q: What is the use of the background-position property? 
A: The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.

Q: Which property controls the image scroll in the background? 
A: The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is fixed.

Q: Why should background and color be used as separate properties? 
A: There are two reasons behind this:
  -It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is combined with color,
   the complexity will further increase.
  -Color is an inherited property while the background is not. So this can make confusion further.

Q: How to center block elements using CSS1? 
A: To centrally align the block elements, we can simply make use of the <center> tag.

Q: How to maintain the CSS specifications? 
A: The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
  -The Specification also specify how stylesheets can be included in your web document and how to target specific media e.g print or screen.
  -The CSS Specification prior to CSS3 was a single Specification, CSS3 on the other hand is divided into Modules which are 
   Independent Specifications that can be worked on by different     author(s) at different paces, that's why we have Selector Level 3 Specification,
   CSS Color 4, CSS Backgrounds and so on. Some of these modules are revisions of CSS2.1, and some are newly created, but all fall under the banner of CSS3.

Q: What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page? 
A: CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in a style attribute.
   By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet. We can also connect to an 
   external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML. 

Q: What is embedded style sheets? 
A: There are three kinds of styles. Inline styles are those that are used as part of the HTML tag itself.
   Embedded styles are located in the header of a page, and apply to that entire page. An external style sheet is a 
   separate text file that each page in the web site can link to it in order to receive it's instructions.

Q: What are the external style sheets? 
A: An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage.
   Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.

Q: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets? 
A: Advantages:
  -With the help of External Style Sheets, the styles of numerous documents can be organized from one single file.
  -In External Style Sheets, Classes can be made for use on numerous HTML element types in many forms of the site.
  -In complex contexts, Methods like selector and grouping can be implemented to apply styles.

   Disadvantages:
  -An extra download is essential to import style information for each file.
  -The execution of the file may be deferred till the external style sheet is loaded.
  -While implementing style sheets, we need to test Web pages with multiple browsers in order to check compatibility issues.

Q: What is the meaning of the CSS selector? 
A: A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which 
   HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.
